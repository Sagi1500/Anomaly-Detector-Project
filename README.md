# Anomaly Detector for Flights Gear.

Simple and Hybrid anomaly detector for Advanced Programming 1 course at BIU in C++

The code includes Design patterns and Polymorphism, STL and other C++ libraries, Threading implementation, TCP connection, and more...

This project is the server-side for an anomaly detection service. Given flight statistics, it can find anomalies using basic probability formulas. In this project, I used Threading - to be able to handle a few clients, OOP design patterns such as command and bridge, and TCP communication, in which (using the strategy DP) the client can approach the server.
You can download the files and change the main as you wish. Then, run the main using an IDE or cmd.
