# Anomaly Detector for Flights Gear.

Simple and Hybrid anomaly detector for Advanced Programming 1 course at BIU in C++

The code includes: Design patterns and Polymorphism, STL and other C++ lybrary, Theading implementation, TCP connection, and more..

This project is the server side for an anomaly detection service. given flight statistics, it can find anomalies using basic probability formulas. In this project I used Threading- in order to be able to handle a few clients, OOP design patterns such as command and bridge, and TCP communication, in which (using the strategy DP) the client can communicate the server. you can download the files and change the main to your wishes, and then run the main using an IDE or cmd.
